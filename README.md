# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting with Regression Models

This project combines statistical research with a web application to explore the effectiveness of **linear regression models** for weather prediction.

---

## 📑 Research Overview
- Analyzed **34 years of historical weather data** (1990–2024) from Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport.  
- Applied **linear regression** and feature engineering to model daily temperatures.  
- Conducted error analysis and model evaluation, achieving **R² ≈ 0.90** with an average error of ~3°F.  
- Reported findings in a **54-page technical paper** applying the **engineering design process**, including evaluation of accuracy, limitations, and potential use cases in public safety, agriculture, and energy.

## 💻 Web Application
- Developed a **Python-based forecasting tool** with a simple, interactive interface.  
- Users can **upload historical weather data** and generate **future forecasts** using the trained regression models.  
- Provides **visualizations of predicted vs. actual trends**, making model performance easy to interpret.  
- Demonstrates how research outcomes can be translated into a **practical, user-friendly tool** for decision-making.
